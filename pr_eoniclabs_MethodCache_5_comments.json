      "body": "## Summary of Changes\n\nHello @johmnym, I'm Gemini Code Assist[^1]! I'm currently reviewing this pull request and will post my feedback shortly. In the meantime, here's a summary to help you and other reviewers quickly get up to speed!\n\nThis pull request introduces a suite of significant enhancements aimed at boosting the performance, observability, and maintainability of the caching library. It primarily focuses on integrating with OpenTelemetry for better monitoring, optimizing asynchronous operations through `ValueTask` adoption, and overhauling the HTTP caching mechanism for greater flexibility and reliability. Additionally, new features like a cache warming service and improved memory management contribute to a more robust and efficient caching solution.\n\n### Highlights\n\n* **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Comprehensive OpenTelemetry integration has been added, including metrics, tracing, and correlation support to enhance observability of cache operations.\n* **Storage Abstraction Refactoring**: The core storage abstractions (`IMemoryStorage`, `IStorageProvider`, `IPersistentStorageProvider`) have been refactored to consistently use `ValueTask` instead of `Task` for asynchronous operations, significantly improving async performance and reducing allocations.\n* **HTTP Caching Enhancements**: The HTTP caching layer has undergone a major refactor, introducing a new fluent builder API for configuration, improved handling of `Vary` headers, and enhanced test reliability. It now uses `IOptionsMonitor` for hot reload capabilities and integrates with the new metrics system.\n* **Asynchronous Write Queuing**: A new asynchronous write queuing mechanism has been implemented in `HybridStorageManager` using `System.Threading.Channels`, allowing L2/L3 cache writes to be processed in the background, improving responsiveness for cache-setting operations.\n* **Cache Warming Service**: A generic cache warming service (`ICacheWarmingService`) has been introduced, enabling proactive refreshing of cache entries before they expire, supported by a new `IDistributedLock` interface for coordination across instances.\n* **Memory Storage Improvements**: The `MemoryStorage` provider has received updates to its tag tracking logic, including a configurable `MaxTagMappings` limit and improved eviction strategies, to prevent memory bloat and ensure consistency.\n* **Core Infrastructure Consolidation**: Several core interfaces and configuration options previously in `MethodCache.Infrastructure` have been moved to `MethodCache.Core`, streamlining the architecture and reducing dependencies.\n* **Dependency Updates**: All project dependencies, including `Microsoft.Extensions.*`, `xunit`, `BenchmarkDotNet`, `StackExchange.Redis`, and `FluentAssertions`, have been updated to their latest versions, ensuring compatibility and leveraging recent performance improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Using Gemini Code Assist</b></summary>\n<br>\n\nThe full guide for Gemini Code Assist can be found on our [documentation page](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/review-github-code), here are some quick tips.\n\n<b>Invoking Gemini</b>\n\nYou can request assistance from Gemini at any point by creating a comment using either `/gemini <command>` or `@gemini-code-assist <command>`.

Calling `SendAsync` with such a response now throws a `NullReferenceException` when the handler checks cacheability, whereas the previous version used null\u2011conditional access. This crash prevents the response from reaching the caller and breaks caching for empty responses. Add a null check around `response.Content` (and its headers) before reading freshness or validation metadata.\n\nUseful? React with \ud83d\udc4d\u00a0/ \ud83d\udc4e.",
