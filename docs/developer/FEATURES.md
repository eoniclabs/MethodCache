# Proposed Features and Integrations for MethodCache

This document outlines a set of proposed features and integrations that would enhance the capabilities, usability, and appeal of the `MethodCache` library.

### 1. Easier to Use API

*   **Automatic Cache Key Generation:** Automatically generate cache keys based on expression trees to reduce boilerplate and prevent errors. If no key is provided, a key will be generated automatically.
*   **Simpler `GetOrCreate` Method:** Provide a simpler overload of the `GetOrCreateAsync` method for the most common use cases.
*   **More Intuitive Invalidation API:** Provide more specific and expressive methods for invalidating cache entries.
*   **Better Documentation and Examples:** Improve the documentation with more examples, a quick-start guide, and better API documentation.
*   **Source Generators for Everything:** Use source generators to reduce boilerplate code and to improve the developer experience.

### 2. ASP.NET Core Caching Integration

*   **What it is:** ASP.NET Core provides a set of caching abstractions, such as `IMemoryCache` and `IDistributedCache`, that are designed to be used in a variety of caching scenarios.
*   **Why it makes sense:** Integrating `MethodCache` with these abstractions would allow it to be used as a drop-in replacement for the default in-memory cache, and it would also enable it to be used in a wider range of ASP.NET Core applications.
*   **How to implement it:**
    *   Create a new `MethodCache.AspNetCore` project.
    *   Implement `IMemoryCache` using the `InMemoryCacheManager`.
    *   Implement `IDistributedCache` using the `RedisCacheManager`.
    *   Provide extension methods to easily register `MethodCache` as the caching provider in `IServiceCollection`.

### 3. HTTP Caching for HttpClient (Client-Side)

*   **What it is:** A standards-compliant HTTP caching handler for `HttpClient` that implements RFC 7234 caching semantics, reducing API calls and improving performance.
*   **Why it makes sense:** Most modern applications consume multiple HTTP APIs. A proper HTTP caching layer can dramatically reduce API calls, respect rate limits, save bandwidth, and improve response times.
*   **Key features:**
    *   **Automatic conditional requests:** Adds `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers
    *   **304 Not Modified handling:** Returns cached content when server responds with 304
    *   **Cache-Control compliance:** Respects `max-age`, `no-cache`, `no-store`, `private`, etc.
    *   **Vary header support:** Caches different responses based on varying headers
    *   **Freshness calculation:** Implements standard HTTP freshness rules including heuristic freshness
    *   **Storage abstraction:** Support for in-memory, Redis, or custom cache storage
*   **How to implement it:**
    ```csharp
    services.AddHttpClient<IApiClient, ApiClient>()
        .AddHttpCaching(options =>
        {
            options.Storage = new RedisHttpCacheStorage(connectionString);
            options.RespectCacheControl = true;
            options.EnableDiagnosticHeaders = true;
        });
    ```

### 3a. HTTP Caching Middleware (Server-Side)

*   **What it is:** A powerful and flexible middleware for ASP.NET Core that provides server-side HTTP caching with fine-grained control.
*   **Why it makes sense:** Complements the client-side HTTP caching by providing server-side cache headers, ETags generation, and conditional request handling.
*   **Features:** Control over cache headers (`Cache-Control`, `Expires`, `Last-Modified`, `Vary`), automatic ETag generation, and conditional GET support.

### 4. TimedETag (inspired by CacheCow)

*   **What it is:** A construct that combines an ETag with a last-modified timestamp for more efficient cache validation.
*   **Why it makes sense:** A `TimedETag` would allow `MethodCache` to perform a quick check of the last-modified timestamp before falling back to a full ETag comparison, which could significantly improve the performance of cache validation.

### 5. Efficient Cache Validation (inspired by CacheCow)

*   **What it is:** An interface that allows the server to query the back-end for a `TimedETag` without having to load the entire resource.
*   **Why it makes sense:** This would allow for more efficient cache validation, as the server could avoid loading the entire resource just to validate the cache.

### 6. Diagnostic Headers (inspired by CacheCow)

*   **What it is:** Diagnostic headers that provide information about cache hits and misses.
*   **Why it makes sense:** This would make it easier for developers to debug their caching policies and to understand how the cache is being used.

### 7. `fast-cache` Provider for High-Performance In-Memory Caching

*   **What it is:** `fast-cache` is a high-performance, lock-free in-memory cache for .NET.
*   **Why it makes sense:** Creating a `MethodCache` provider that uses `fast-cache` as its underlying store would provide a significant performance boost for in-memory caching, especially in high-concurrency scenarios. This would be an excellent option for the L1 cache in a hybrid caching setup.
*   **How to implement it:**
    *   Create a new `MethodCache.Providers.FastCache` project.
    *   Implement `ICacheManager` using `fast-cache` as the underlying store.
    *   Provide an extension method to easily register the `FastCacheManager` in `IServiceCollection`.

### 8. Advanced Resilience (inspired by FusionCache)

*   **What it is:** A set of advanced resilience features to protect the application from cache-related failures.
*   **Why it makes sense:** `MethodCache` could be made more robust by adding features like cache stampede prevention, a fail-safe mechanism to reuse expired entries, and auto-recovery.

### 9. Eager Refresh (inspired by FusionCache)

*   **What it is:** A feature that automatically refreshes cache entries in the background before they expire.
*   **Why it makes sense:** This helps to ensure that the cache is always up-to-date and that users don't have to wait for a cache entry to be regenerated.

### 10. Named Caches (inspired by FusionCache)

*   **What it is:** The ability to create multiple named caches.
*   **Why it makes sense:** This is a useful feature for isolating different parts of an application and for having different configurations for different caches.

### 11. OpenTelemetry Integration

*   **What it is:** OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework for collecting and exporting telemetry data (metrics, traces, and logs).
*   **Why it makes sense:** Integrating `MethodCache` with OpenTelemetry would provide deep insights into the performance and behavior of the caching system. Developers could easily monitor cache hit/miss ratios, latency, and other important metrics in their favorite observability tools (e.g., Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog).
*   **How to implement it:**
    *   Create a new `MethodCache.OpenTelemetry` project.
    *   Implement an `ActivitySource` to create traces for cache operations.
    *   Implement a `Meter` to record cache-related metrics (e.g., hits, misses, latency).
    *   Provide an extension method to easily add `MethodCache` telemetry to the application's `TracerProvider` and `MeterProvider`.

### 12. Polly Integration for Advanced Resilience

*   **What it is:** Polly is a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library that allows developers to express policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback in a fluent and thread-safe manner.
*   **Why it makes sense:** The `RedisCacheManager` already has a basic resilience pipeline, but it could be much more powerful and flexible. Integrating with Polly would allow developers to configure advanced resilience strategies for their cache operations.
*   **How to implement it:**
    *   Create a new `MethodCache.Resilience.Polly` project.
    *   Provide a way to configure Polly policies for the `CacheManager`.
    *   Use the Polly policies to wrap the cache operations in the `RedisCacheManager`.

### 13. Support for Other Caching Providers

*   **What it is:** `MethodCache` currently has an in-memory cache and a Redis cache provider. Adding support for other popular caching providers would make the library more versatile.
*   **Why it makes sense:** Different applications have different caching needs and constraints. Supporting a wider range of caching providers would allow developers to choose the best one for their specific use case.
*   **Potential providers to add:**
    *   **Memcached:** A popular, high-performance, in-memory key-value store.
    *   **Azure Cache for Redis:** A fully managed Redis service from Microsoft Azure.
    *   **AWS ElastiCache:** A fully managed Redis or Memcached service from Amazon Web Services.
    *   **SQL Server:** A distributed cache provider that uses a SQL Server database as the backing store.

### 14. Cache Stale-While-Revalidate

*   **What it is:** This is a caching strategy where stale data is served to the user while a new version of the data is fetched in the background.
*   **Why it makes sense:** This strategy can significantly improve the perceived performance of an application, as users will always get a fast response, even if the data is slightly out of date.
*   **How to implement it:**
    *   Add a `StaleWhileRevalidate` option to the `CacheEntryOptions`.
    *   When a stale entry is requested, return the stale data and trigger a background task to refresh the cache.

### 15. Jitter for Cache Expiration

*   **What it is:** Jitter is the practice of adding a small, random amount of time to the expiration of a cache entry.
*   **Why it makes sense:** This can help to prevent cache stampedes, where a large number of cache entries expire at the same time, causing a sudden spike in load on the underlying data source.
*   **How to implement it:**
    *   Add a `WithJitter` option to the `CacheEntryOptions`.
    *   When setting a cache entry, add a small, random amount of time to the expiration.

### 16. Distributed `ICacheKeyGenerator`

*   **What it is:** The current `ICacheKeyGenerator` is designed to be used in a single process. In a distributed environment, it's important to have a consistent way of generating cache keys across all instances of an application.
*   **Why it makes sense:** A distributed `ICacheKeyGenerator` would ensure that all instances of an application generate the same cache key for the same method and arguments, which is essential for a distributed cache to work correctly.
*   **How to implement it:**
    *   Create a new `IDistributedCacheKeyGenerator` interface.
    *   Implement a `RedisCacheKeyGenerator` that uses Redis to generate unique and consistent cache keys.

### 17. Fluent Configuration API

*   **What it is:** A fluent, chainable API for configuring MethodCache that makes setup more intuitive and discoverable.
*   **Why it makes sense:** Current DI registration can be verbose and hard to discover. A fluent API provides better IntelliSense support and makes configuration more readable.
*   **How to implement it:**
    ```csharp
    // Instead of complex configuration objects
    services.AddMethodCache()
        .WithDefaultDuration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5))
        .WithRedis("connection-string")
        .WithInMemoryL1Cache()
        .WithTags("api", "user-data")
        .WithMetrics()
        .WithDebugMode(isDevelopment);
    ```

### 18. Minimal API Integration

*   **What it is:** First-class support for ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs with attribute-based caching.
*   **Why it makes sense:** Minimal APIs are becoming increasingly popular, and they should have the same caching capabilities as controller-based APIs.
*   **How to implement it:**
    ```csharp
    app.MapGet("/users/{id}", [Cache(Duration = "00:05:00")]
        async (int id, IUserService service) => await service.GetUserAsync(id));
    ```

### 19. Smart Default Behaviors

*   **What it is:** Intelligent defaults that reduce configuration overhead while providing powerful caching behavior.
*   **Why it makes sense:** Most developers want caching to "just work" without extensive configuration, but still need control when needed.
*   **Features to include:**
    *   **Auto-expire on model changes:** Automatically invalidate when related entities change
    *   **Dependency-based invalidation:** `[Cache(InvalidateOn = typeof(User))]`
    *   **Smart key generation:** Include assembly version, environment, tenant ID automatically
    *   **Adaptive expiration:** Automatically adjust cache duration based on hit/miss patterns

### 20. Zero-Configuration Experience

*   **What it is:** MethodCache should work perfectly out of the box with just `services.AddMethodCache()`.
*   **Why it makes sense:** Reduces friction for new users and provides fastest time-to-value.
*   **How to implement it:**
    ```csharp
    // Should work immediately with sensible defaults
    services.AddMethodCache(); // InMemory, 5min default, auto-keying

    // Complex configuration becomes the advanced scenario
    services.AddMethodCache(builder => builder
        .WithCustomKeyGeneration()
        .WithAdvancedInvalidation()
        .WithDistributedLocking());
    ```

### 21. Developer Experience Enhancements

*   **What it is:** Tools and features specifically designed to improve the development and debugging experience.
*   **Why it makes sense:** Good developer experience leads to faster adoption and fewer support issues.
*   **Features to include:**
    *   **Cache debugging tools:** `[Cache(Debug = true)]` logs cache decisions in development
    *   **Cache health checks:** Built-in health monitoring with `services.AddHealthChecks().AddMethodCacheHealthCheck()`
    *   **Performance insights:** Built-in metrics and dashboards
    *   **Configuration validation:** Compile-time and runtime validation of cache configurations

### 22. Enhanced Source Generator Features

*   **What it is:** More powerful source generators that reduce boilerplate and improve compile-time safety.
*   **Why it makes sense:** Source generators can eliminate runtime reflection and provide better IntelliSense support.
*   **Features to include:**
    *   **Auto-generate cache interfaces:** `[GenerateCache]` creates `ICachedUserService` automatically
    *   **Compile-time validation:** Validate cache configurations at build time
    *   **Optimized code generation:** Generate highly optimized cache code with no runtime overhead
    *   **Configuration validation:** Use .NET 8+ `[OptionsValidator]` for configuration validation

### 23. Cloud-Native and Modern .NET Features

*   **What it is:** Features specifically designed for cloud-native applications and modern .NET environments.
*   **Why it makes sense:** Most modern applications are deployed in cloud environments and need cloud-aware caching strategies.
*   **Features to include:**
    *   **Kubernetes-aware invalidation:** Coordinate cache invalidation across pods
    *   **Environment-based configuration:** Different cache strategies per environment (dev/staging/prod)
    *   **Circuit breaker integration:** Fail gracefully when cache providers are down
    *   **Container-aware defaults:** Automatically detect containerized environments and adjust defaults

### 24. Performance-First Defaults

*   **What it is:** Default configurations and behaviors optimized for performance in common scenarios.
*   **Why it makes sense:** Performance should be excellent by default, not something developers need to tune extensively.
*   **Features to include:**
    *   **Warm-up hints:** `[Cache(WarmUp = true)]` for critical paths
    *   **Background refresh:** Automatic background refresh before expiration
    *   **Batch operations:** Efficient bulk cache operations
    *   **Memory-efficient serialization:** Use the most efficient serialization for each data type
