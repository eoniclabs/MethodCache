# Changelog

Changes that a user of the packages notices. The release steps are in
[docs/developer/RELEASE.md](docs/developer/RELEASE.md); when you tag a release, copy its section into the GitHub
release.

## Unreleased (1.0.0)

### If you used a pre-release build from GitHub Packages

- **Generated `Add{Interface}WithCaching` methods are gone.** Combined with `AddMethodCache()` they registered the
  service twice. Register the interface the usual way (with a factory if you need one), before `AddMethodCache()`.
- **Keys for array and collection arguments.** The decorator now writes them into the key itself
  (`ByIdsAsync:[3:1:2:3]`) instead of hashing them, so they also work under Native AOT. Distributed cache entries
  written by a pre-release build for such methods are misses and expire normally.

- **HTTP cache keys.** Keys are now length-framed, so every HTTP response cache key changes, including for requests
  without `Vary` headers. Entries written by a pre-release build are not read again; this applies to the built-in and
  to custom HTTP cache storage. Let them expire, or clear the storage namespace when you deploy.
- **Distributed invalidation.** Backplane key and tag messages use new message types and lossless UTF-16 encoding,
  and distributed cache entries use envelope version 4. Invalidations do not cross between a pre-release build and
  1.0.0 in either direction: a node ignores backplane messages from another MethodCache version and logs one warning,
  and entries written by a pre-release build are cache misses. Upgrade every node that shares a cache and backplane
  together, with a cache clear, or use a new cache namespace.
- **SQL Server tables.** The invalidations table gets a nullable `Scope binary(32)` column and the indexes
  `Index_Scope_Id (Scope, Id)` and `Index_Scope_CreatedAt (Scope, CreatedAt)`; with `CreateTablesIfMissing = false`,
  add them in your migration before deploying. Rows without a scope are ignored and deleted once they are older than
  `BackplaneRetention`. Cache rows written by a pre-release build (unhashed keys) become misses and expire normally.
  Upgrade every instance that shares the tables together, and restart them with empty in-memory caches.
